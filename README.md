# Taggy - A hub for insightful discussions and streamlined data retrieval
## Introduction
While most of the forum discussion platforms available today allow users can engage in conversations by posting messages, sharing information, asking questions, and interacting with others on a variety of topics, retrieving information from the thread can only be done in only one way, retrieving information from the thread can only be done in one way: manually dragging the relevant part from the post and copying it into the clipboard. For instance, for the thread about solving a coding problem, the most relevant information is the code snippet. Imagine users having to retrieve information from multiple threads; manually copying one by one can be tedious.

This project aims to solve this problem by integrating a built-in data retrieval system. Inspired by an online-shopping platform, where users click on products into their shopping carts and pay for them in a single click, this web forum allows users to filter irrelevant information from multiple threads and retrieve the information at once. 

## Objectives
- To provide an easy to use forum discussion platform.
- Streamline the process of getting relevant information within forum threads, reducing manual copying and pasting.

# Quick start
## Building and Running the App Locally
To start a local development server, make sure to install the required dependencies by running `npm install`. Then, you can start the local server by executing `npm start`.

After you have run the following commands, the development server will be hosted at port 3000 `http://localhost:3000/`.
